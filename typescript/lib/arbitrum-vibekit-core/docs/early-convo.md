# Context

Let me give you a little bit of background on what I'm trying to create. The main idea is to make a very lightweight AI agent framework that's extremely easy for junior developers to grasp and build their own agents. These agents are MCP servers out of the box because MCP has gained wide adoption and A2A hasn't. Agent as a tool is also one of the most simple and powerful orchestration patterns available.

One very common problem that I've uncovered is that often there needs to be special logic between an LLM tool call either before the request or the response for various reasons. Ideally simple agents are stateless, but automated agents require state for long-running tasks. A single MCP tool request and response can remain stateless itself, but support the handling of a stateful agent task.

What would be the best way to design a pattern that modifies an existing tool call schema that the LLM sees? Say I have an MCP tool with a schema that the MCP server supplied, but I need the logic of the hook or middleware to be an adapter that provides a new schema to the LLM, does stuff in-between, and then invokes the tool with the original schema.

A concrete example is that the user interfaces with the LLM using token symbols like "USDC" or "ETH", but let's say the tool the LLM calls to look up the current price requires an ID composed of the chain ID and token address that maps directly to the entity. The LLM needs the "getPrice" tool schema to have a "tokenSymbol" parameter, the hook or middleware needs to map that to the ID and then call the original tool and schema.

---

The other example is wallet for wallet signing. The user wants to buy ETH with USDC, so the LLM calls the "swapToken" tool (let's ignore any token mapping). Then the tool response returns transaction data to sign. The after hook or middleware prompts the user to sign the transaction. Then those results are returned to the LLM, not the transaction data.

Why aren't you using any classes? Are functions better for some reason?

The schemas of tools from MCP servers aren't exactly known up front. The schema is returned to the MCP client when the client requests available tools. Typically this doesn't matter because the LLM uses the tool schema dynamically in it's context. How should we handle this? From experience, I find myself creating a zod schema from learning about the tool I'm working with.

Also, we're not always working with MCP tools, but sometimes just tools defined locally. Those local tools might be simple functions, or more in-depth LLM workflows. Are pre and post hooks still useful? Maybe for logging? Are there any other considerations that we need to explore?

How should we define a global state object? The tools might need to transform or modify state that's not part of before or after tool parameter set. Should such state be immutable with updates working with a copy? Are there any reasons to use reducers?

How can we keep the junior devs getting confused from state hooks vs tool hooks. I can see them easily getting mixed up. Could they even be one in the same?

State should be mostly user created depending on the agent they build. So it needs to be easily customizable with maybe some sort of lightweight reserved fields for the framework itself for very common things.

Should we just hard couple to Langgraph's state management system? It could be nice, but there won't always be graphs as part of an agent. So I don't know if their state management works without creating a graph.

Do you think the LLM's system prompt should live in this state too? And/or a set of key-values that are reserved for the LLM's context, and another set that avoid the LLM's context. We'll need this to be really easy for a junior to understand.

# Message 1

Review the entire conversation and architecture. Are there any lessons or design patterns we can learn from React, Redux, Express, Agent2Agent, Model Context Protocol, Vercel AI SDK, or LangGraph that we may have missed or overlooked?

# Response 1

Below is a pattern-spotting “retro” across every layer we’ve discussed. I highlight design idioms that React, Redux, Express, A2A, MCP, the Vercel AI SDK and LangGraph have already solved—and show where we can still borrow or tighten screws.

---

## Key take-aways in one breath

React teaches us **component boundaries** and “context providers” for scoping global vs. local state; Redux shows how **slice reducers, entity-adapter normalisation and DevTools time-travel** make debugging safe; Express reminds us that **first-class error middleware** is cheaper than `try/catch` spam; Agent2Agent nails **thread IDs and capability discovery** so long-running multi-agent work never loses context; Model Context Protocol bakes-in **tool metadata, version tags and standard error codes** so clients can reason about upgrades; the Vercel AI SDK demonstrates **stream-as-default and pluggable providers** to hide model churn; and LangGraph offers **reducers, loop/branch primitives and graphical time-travel** that we can tap even if we don’t build a full graph. These patterns suggest a handful of concrete tweaks: adopt a **Provider-style “StateContext” wrapper** for global data; expose a **DevTools-ready action log** (à la Redux) for replay; promote **param-level adapters** to first-class “tool components”; add a single **`errors/` folder** with Express-style handlers for both local tools and MCP calls; and reserve top-level store keys (`__meta`, `__llm`) exactly the way MCP and A2A reserve their JSON-RPC fields.

---

## 1 Lessons from React & React-Hooks

### Context Provider pattern

React’s Context is a _dependency-injection_ channel, not a store—but it shows how to give each subtree an isolated slice .
**Borrow:** ship a lightweight `StateProvider` wrapper that injects the _GlobalStore_ instance into every tool, keeping user-defined store slices from colliding with framework slices.

### Custom Hooks = reusable side-effect bundles

Single-purpose hooks (`useTrace()`, `useLimiter()`) keep cross-cutting logic readable.
**Borrow:** expose `useStoreSlice(key)` and `useTaskState(id)` wrappers so juniors never mutate raw Immer drafts.

---

## 2 Redux patterns still worth stealing

| Pattern                                           | Why it matters                                           | Borrow into agent                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normalized entity tables**                      | Flat, ID-keyed tables avoid double updates & deep copies | Recommend `state/cache.tokensBySymbol` ⇒ `{ byId, allIds }` for token lists |
| **Slice reducers & RTK `createSlice` ergonomics** | Self-contained “slice” modules cut boilerplate           | Template a `createSlice` helper over our Immer store                        |
| **DevTools time-travel**                          | Immutable updates + action log enable replay             | Keep the reducer queue and expose a small `/debug/events.ndjson` stream     |

> **Missed earlier:** we talked reducers but not _selectors_. Add memoised `select*` helpers so LLM-heavy computations can reuse derived data without recompute.

---

## 3 Express middleware super-powers we skipped

- **Central async-error wrapper** – Express 5 auto-passes rejected promises to the error handler ; a 3-line `wrapAsync` keeps every tool tiny .
- **Param middleware** – `router.param('id', loadUser)` pre-loads entities; mirror this with a _tool-param transformer_ registry so common look-ups (e.g., symbol → address) auto-run before hooks fire.

---

## 4 Agent2Agent extras

- **`thread_id` & `message_id`** – every A2A message ties back to a long-running task .
- **`AgentCard.capabilities` discovery** – lets a caller filter peers before invoking .
- **Standard error enums** (`A2A-SPEC-…`) give debuggers one place to branch .

> 🔧 _Action_: embed `threadId` and `capabilities` mirrors into our task store so an agent can later delegate work over A2A with zero glue code.

---

## 5 Model Context Protocol guard-rails

MCP’s spec already mandates:

- **Tool metadata fields** (`title`, `examples`, `version`)&#x20;
- **Uniform JSON-RPC error codes** (`-32001 UnknownTool`, `-32602 InvalidParams`)&#x20;
- **Streaming chunks** over SSE for long calls&#x20;

> **Gap:** we built adapters but never surfaced the _upstream_ tool’s `version`. Store it under `tool._version` and reject if it bumps unexpectedly.

---

## 6 Vercel AI SDK streaming design

- **Streaming first-class** – SDK has `toDataStreamResponse()` & `experimental_transform` for in-flight mutation .
- **Swappable providers** – same code path works for OpenAI, Groq, Together etc. .

> **Borrow:** expose a `streamTransform` hook (before `after`) so devs can uppercase, filter tokens, or inject tool calls mid-stream—mirroring the SDK’s transform API.

---

## 7 LangGraph state & control-flow gems

- **Reducers bound to state keys** let you declare merge logic once .
- **Built-in loops, branches, parallelism** save DIY control-flow .
- **Time-travel & visualisation** come free .

> _Practical takeaway_: keep our `connectGraph(graph)` adapter so any agent can opt-in to LangGraph later and gain visual debugging without rewrites.

---

## 8 Concrete tweaks to adopt now

1. **Provider boundary**
   _Create `StateProvider` that injects `store` & `dispatch`—React-style dependency-injection even for non-React code._

2. **`selectors/` folder**
   _Ship `createSelector(key, fn)` helper; juniors read from selectors, not raw store._

3. **Central `errors/` registry**
   _Merges Express error middleware, MCP error enums and A2A error enums into one source._

4. **`streamTransform` hook**
   _Mirrors Vercel AI SDK’s transform—it’s just `(delta) ⇒ delta'`._

5. **`__versionMap` slice**
   _Caches `{ toolName: version }`; reject adapter calls when upstream bumps a semver without migration._

6. **DevTools NDJSON log**
   _Every action (state reducer) is appended to `/debug/events.ndjson`—time-travel via curl._

---

## 9 Quick reference table

| Pattern                     | Where we saw it            | Fix/feature for our framework            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Context Provider            | React                      | `StateProvider` for global store         |
| Normalised tables           | Redux                      | `entityAdapter` helper for caches        |
| Central async error handler | Express                    | `wrapAsync(tool)` utility                |
| Capability discovery        | A2A                        | Expose `agentCapabilities` in task state |
| Tool version pin            | MCP                        | Auto-save & compare `schema.version`     |
| Stream transform            | Vercel AI SDK              | `streamTransform` hook                   |
| Reducer visual time-travel  | LangGraph + Redux DevTools | `/debug/events.ndjson` endpoint          |

---

### Bottom line

Most of the heavy lifting has proven patterns in other ecosystems; adopting a _Provider + selector_ UX, an _immutable action log_, _error middleware_, _stream transforms_ and _version-pin awareness_ will spare junior developers confusion and hand you replay-able, debuggable, up-gradable agents “for free.”

# Message 2

- "keeping user-defined store slices from colliding with framework slices" but the user still needs a simple way to add things to the llm context. I'm sure the system prompt can live in it's own file that is easy for the user to modify, but they need to be able to customize what key-value pairs go into the LLM context
- I don't understand what a slice is. If I'm already having a hard time with this up until now, is a slice already too much for our lightweight framework? I do like these other redux patterns as core patterns to steal though.
- What do you mean by common look-ups? e.g., symbol → address would be user defined, not part of the extremely lightweight framework.
- "Built-in loops, branches, parallelism" we'll just reserve this for LangGraph itself. Users can build graphs inside of the tool function itself. However, our agents do need to run loops or events in relationship to A2A tasks. Are loops and events already part of the A2A spec?
- Is there anything we can learn from the new OpenAI Agents SDK?
- Is there anything we can learn from the new x402 spec? Does our framework design already have compatibility with how x402 works?

# Response 2

### 1 • Keep user control of what the LLM “sees” — _without collisions_

| Goal                                                                                                        | Pragmatic rule                                                                                                                                       | DX helper you can ship |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Framework must keep its own housekeeping keys **and** let devs drop arbitrary data into the prompt context. | **Everything that must go into the model lives under one reserved root key**: `store.__llm.ctx`. Anything else in `store` is invisible to the model. | \`\`\`ts               |
| import { update } from "../state/store";                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                      |                        |

export const addCtx = (kv: Record\<string, any>) =>
update(d => Object.assign(d.\_\_llm.ctx, kv));

````|

*Dev flow*

```ts
addCtx({ favoriteToken: "USDC", riskTolerance: "low" });
````

At the final “call-LLM” hop the framework simply spreads that object:

```ts
model.prompt = `${store.__llm.systemPrompt}\n${JSON.stringify(
  store.__llm.ctx
)}`;
```

Nothing else in the global store can accidentally leak.

---

### 2 • “What’s a slice?” — make it so small they won’t ask

> A **slice** is _just_ “one top-level key in the store, owned by one feature.”

If juniors ever touch only two slices:

```ts
store.__llm; // framework-reserved
store.cache; // their own stuff
```

…then the word “slice” never even appears in the docs.
(You can still scaffold `state/createSlice(name, initial)` for seniors who want Redux-style ergonomics.)

---

### 3 • “Common look-ups” ≈ user-defined **param-transform registry**

_Not_ in the framework core. Provide a helper:

```ts
registerParamTransform("tokenSymbol", (symbol) => {
  const map = store.cache.tokensBySymbol; // user-owned slice
  return map[symbol] ?? symbol; // default passthrough
});
```

Tool authors opt-in:

```ts
export const before: Hook = (ctx) =>
  (ctx.args = applyParamTransforms(ctx.args));
```

No opinionated mapping logic baked into the skeleton.

---

### 4 • Loops & events in A2A

The **A2A spec only gives you long-running _tasks_ + SSE streams** (`tasks/sendSubscribe`, `tasks/resubscribe`) and explicit `cancel` calls ([Google GitHub][1]).
It does **not** prescribe looping or cron-style triggers.
So:

- Let the lightweight agent start an internal timer / event emitter and post progress updates back to the A2A task stream.
- If the agent never needs a full LangGraph, that loop can live entirely inside one tool function.

---

### 5 • What the OpenAI **Agents SDK** teaches us

| SDK feature                                             | What we can borrow                                                                                                                                | Source        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Guardrails** (validate input/output against policies) | Add an optional `validate.before`, `validate.after` pair that runs _before_ ordinary hooks.                                                       | ([OpenAI][2]) |
| **Tracing & Observability**                             | Pipe every `before/after` event to an ND-JSON stream (`/debug/events.ndjson`).                                                                    | ([OpenAI][2]) |
| **Agent hand-offs**                                     | Our existing “adapter-tool” + A2A call already covers this; document the pattern as _“handoff = invoke adapter that posts `tasks/send` to peer.”_ |               |

These are drop-in; no need for the whole SDK.

---

### 6 • Where **x402** fits

- x402 turns an HTTP 402 **Payment Required** into a live USDC invoice that agents can settle on-chain ([Cointelegraph][3], [x402.org][4]).
- Compatibility is trivial: treat **402** like any other HTTP error in `wrapAsync()`. Provide one built-in **payment middleware**:

```ts
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    await next();
  } catch (e) {
    if (e.status === 402 && e.headers["x-paylink"]) {
      // call wallet tool, settle invoice, retry original request
    } else throw e;
  }
});
```

Because our framework already supports **after-hooks and retries**, nothing else changes.
If a tool itself needs to _charge_ via x402, expose an adapter that returns `402` when the caller hasn’t pre-funded.

---

### 7 • Checklist of remaining “React / Redux / Express / LangGraph” gems we _have_ now covered

| Pattern                                                      | Borrowed where                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Context Provider** (React)                                 | `StateProvider` that injects `store`, `dispatch` |
| **Entity adapters** (Redux)                                  | Helper for `cache.tokens.byId` normalisation     |
| **Error middleware** (Express)                               | `wrapAsync(tool)` + central `errors/` folder     |
| **Version pin / capability discovery** (MCP + A2A)           | `__meta.toolVersion`, `agentCapabilities` slices |
| **Stream transforms** (Vercel AI SDK)                        | `streamTransform(delta)=>delta'` hook            |
| **Reducer log for time-travel** (Redux DevTools / LangGraph) | `/debug/events.ndjson`                           |

Nothing critical left on the table.

---

### TL;DR for juniors

1. **Put extra prompt keys here →** `store.__llm.ctx`.
2. **Add permanent data here →** `store.cache` (or any new top-level key).
3. **Need a loop?** Start a timer inside your tool; send progress via `tasks/send`.
4. **Hit a 402?** The payment middleware will pop a wallet prompt, pay, and retry.

That keeps the framework tiny, learnable, and still future-proof for A2A tasks, x402 payments, and OpenAI’s emerging Agent SDK ideas.

# Message 3

- Should the agent itself run on a loop, or just have the option to start a loop-based Task through a tool upon a user request?
- Should the scaffolding of the agent itself be a class because it needs to setup and run as a MCP/A2A/Express server?
- Can x402 be used for on-demand micropayments per call and per endpoint?
- Do you think the double underscores in `__llm` make the junior feel like it shouldn't be touched though? What if we did `llm.__meta` instead for the framework internal stuff and allowed the user to modify `llm.ctx`?
- I'm not talking about our agent hitting a 402, but rather our agent charging micro-payments for it's own services/invocation.

# Response 3

Below is a point-by-point answer, then a compact design cheat-sheet you can paste into your repo.

---

## 1 Run-loop for the whole agent, or start loops on demand?

| Option                                     | What happens                                                                                                                    | Fit with A2A & MCP                                                                                                                      | Recommendation                                                        |

| **Loop-task** spun up **from a tool call** | User (or LLM) invokes `startCron({ taskId, every })` → tool stores a timer; each tick posts progress to `tasks/send` SSE stream | Matches A2A: the loop _is_ the long-running task; status & artifacts flow over the task stream ([Google GitHub][1], [Google GitHub][2]) | **Yes**—keep core agent event-free; expose a “loop-task” helper tool  |

**TL;DR** : ship a tiny helper (`createLoopTask(fn, everyMs)`) that a tool can call; the agent itself stays idle until asked.

## 2 Should the scaffold be a **class**?

## 3 Using **x402** for per-call micropayments

The spec is literally “HTTP 402 + `x-paylink` header → pay with USDC → retry” ([Coinbase][3], [x402][4], [CCN.com][5]).
You can:

1. **Tag** any tool with a price:

   ```ts
   price: { amount: "0.05", currency: "USDC" }
   ```

2. **Before-hook** checks `ctx.headers["x402-paid"]`.

   - If absent, respond with 402 and `x-paylink`.
   - Framework middleware auto-reruns the handler once the Wallet-tool settles the invoice.

3. **After-hook** can emit a usage event for accounting.

So yes—full pay-per-endpoint, on demand.

## 4 Naming the LLM slice

> “Double underscores feel scary—juniors might avoid it.”

Switch to **`llm.*`**, reserve **`llm.meta`** for the framework, and let users own **`llm.ctx`**:

```ts
store.llm = {
  meta: { systemPrompt: "..." }, // framework writes/reads
  ctx: { riskTolerance: "low" }, // user code mutates freely
};
```

This keeps the “one root key ⇒ model context” rule, without the intimidation factor.

## 5 Charging **your own** micro-payments (not just paying others)

_Same mechanism, reversed_:

1. **Before-hook** on a paid tool inspects the request.
2. If no `x402-paid` header → return `402 Payment Required` + `x-paylink`.
3. Caller (could be another agent) settles and retries.

Because x402 is symmetrical, your framework needs only the one paywall helper to both charge and pay.

## 6 Loose ends & design cheats

| Topic                | Decision / Helper                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop tasks**       | `createLoopTask(fn, { everyMs, taskId })` – stores timer ID in task state and streams heartbeat via `tasks/send`.    |
| **Agent scaffold**   | `createAgent({ tools, port, a2a: true/false })` returns `{ start, stop }`. Internally a class, externally functions. |
| **x402 integration** | `withPaywall(price)(tool)` HOC; global Express error handler retries paid calls automatically.                       |
| **LLM context**      | Root key `llm.meta` (framework) + `llm.ctx` (user). Framework concatenates both into prompt.                         |
| **State naming**     | Any top-level key = a “slice”. You only need to know two today: `llm` and `cache`.                                   |

With these tweaks the framework stays < 300 LOC, juniors see **two folders (tools / state)**, and you still tick every box—A2A streaming, MCP tools, optional LangGraph graphs, and x402 pay-per-call monetisation.

Happy building!
