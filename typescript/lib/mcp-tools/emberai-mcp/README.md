## EmberAI MCP Server

Ember is a powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as a one-stop solution for managing and executing complex DeFi operations across multiple chains. By providing simple, well-documented interfaces, Ember empowers AI agents to dynamically select, compose, and interact with DeFi protocols without the need for custom implementations.

Ember's declarative DeFi layer enables AI agents to interpret and execute user intents while offering developers a unified interface to the entire DeFi ecosystem. With access to rich market data, developers can leverage Ember to create custom DeFi strategies and effortlessly automate advanced workflows.

## Prerequisites

**1. Node.js ≥22**

**2. pnpm**

**3. TypeScript** (configured in the `tsconfig.json` file)

## Quickstart

1. Clone the Vibekit repository and navigate to the `emberai-mcp` folder.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit.git &&
   cd arbitrum-vibekit/typescript/lib/mcp-tools/emberai-mcp

   ```

2. Install dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm install &&
   pnpm build
   ```

3. Start the MCP server:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

      Clients can now connect via STDIO transport to invoke the MCP tools. For instance, you can use the Inspector to interact with Ember's MCP tools. In a new terminal, run the following to launch the inspector:

      ```bash
      npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
      ```

      Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:6274 in your browser to access the interface and click on "Connect" to establish a connection with your local server:
